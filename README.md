<p align="center" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Personal photography website built with react.</p>

## The problem
I needed an easy, fast and flexible way to upload and display my personal photos while continuing my react journey.

## This solution
I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap this project. [Contentful](https://contentful.com) was used for the CMS to upload and store the image and details data. This was chosen as it was free, fast and intuitive to add future photos. As this was a learning opportunity I decided to take the project a step further and added a shopping cart system with redux toolkit.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
